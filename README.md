Capybara-Harness implements a test harness strategy allowing you to easily query and manipulate your DOM elements
as self-contained objects in the context of your feature or acceptance tests.

By pulling redundant behavior out of your scenarios and tests (such as filling our forms or ensuring a comment element
is visible on the page), you focus on the essential steps of your use cases and the intent of your features becomes
more legible.

## Installation

    gem 'capybara-harness'
